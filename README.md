# SOA-Monolith
## Introduction 

This is an practical academic exercise to incentive the study of DevOps and Software Architecture.

### Objectives
-Understanding motivations to break a monolith
-Using a scientific approach to detail architectural changes
-Promoting the adoption of tests during development step
-Promoting the knowledge of Deployment Pipeline
-Sharing tactics to support deployability, availability and scalability

### Steps 
1. Decompose SOA-Monolith (this repository) in PEDIDO service and CLIENTE service, and documenting the Architectural Decisions
2. Write automated tests (Unit Tests)
3. Pass tests trough pipeline (https://circleci.com/ or Jenkins)
4. Deploy Services on Google Cloud or Amazon AWS
5. Replicate PEDIDO service (>2 instances) and support availability.
