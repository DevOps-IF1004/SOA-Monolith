# SOA-Monolith
= Introduction =
This is an practical academic exercise to incentive the study of DevOps and Software Architecture.

== Objectives ==
-Understanding motivations to break a monolith
-Using a scientific approach to detail architectural changes
-Promoting the adoption of tests during development step
-Promoting the knowledge of Deployment Pipeline
-Sharing tactics to support deployability, availability and scalability

== Steps ==
I-	Decomposing SOA-Monolith (this repository) in PEDIDO service and CLIENTE service, and documenting the Architectural Decisions
II-	Writing automated tests (Unit Tests)
III-	Passing tests trough pipeline (https://circleci.com/ or Jenkins)
IV-	Deploy Services on Google Cloud or Amazon AWS
V-	Replicate PEDIDO service (>2 instances) and support availability.
